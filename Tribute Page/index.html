        Alan Turing was a pioneering British computer scientist, mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II, he worked at Bletchley Park and played a vital role in breaking the Enigma code, which significantly shortened the war. His work laid the foundation for modern computing and continues to influence research today.
